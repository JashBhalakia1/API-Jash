1. This is my work: Jash Bhalakia - 165971
2. In this code you will be able to register your self using your email and password which will then lead to you getting an OTP in your email using PHPMailer.
3. Then once you succesfully verify your code you will be then able to login using your email and password and then redirecting to a page.
4. I have also added a special feature of resetting password using a link you get in your email.
5. The link will redirect you to a site where you will be able to create your new password or if you remember your old password then you can use that as well.
